## Contributing

### Code Conventions

To maintain code consistency, adhere to our coding conventions outlined in our [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md). Consistent code makes it easier for everyone to read and contribute.

### Assigning Issues

Before starting to write code, it's essential to assign yourself to an issue. This ensures that no two people work simultaneously on the same issue, reducing duplication of effort. \
If you're interested in working on an issue that isn't assigned to anyone, feel free to request being assigned through a comment on the issue itself.

### Finding Issues

In order to find issues available, please look at the `Ready For Dev` column inside each project in our [Projects page](https://github.com/orgs/Maakaf/projects/). Please note that every page of the website has its own project.

### Creating a New Issue

If you encounter a bug or have a new feature idea, please create a new issue from our [Issues page](https://github.com/Maakaf/maakaf-website/issues) by clicking the "New issue" button. Provide a detailed description of the problem or feature, steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable), and any relevant information.

### Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please be respectful and considerate of others when communicating and collaborating within our community.

## Pull Requests

### Creating a Pull Request

When you've completed your work on an issue, it's time to create a pull request (PR). Follow these steps:

1. Ensure your fork is up to date with the latest changes from the main repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Commit your changes with clear and concise messages.
4. Push your changes to your fork.
5. Open a PR against the main repository's `main` branch.
6. **Describe the purpose of your PR and reference the related issue (e.g., "Closes #1").**

`Feel free to contact the maintainers for giving you a code review`

## Community

### Communication

Join our [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/uZvKfvG7NU) to connect with other contributors, ask questions, and share your experiences. We welcome your feedback and ideas!

If you feel the maintainers are not noticing your PR or changes you've made on it, shouting out in the channel will grab our attention :)
